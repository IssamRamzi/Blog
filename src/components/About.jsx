          interest in coding, electronics and computers in general.

        <p>
          this website serves as more or less dumping ground of useless
          information. here, you may find how to contact me, crap i've written
          and things that you might find interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          currently, the domain is looking like shit, i'm broke so the domain{" "}
          <em>might</em> change from time to time
        </p>

        <h2>contact me</h2>

        <p>
          i go by the name of <span>kefelle</span> on discord, feel free to
          message me, i'm not that interesting but a chat clearly won't hurt me
          :)
        </p>

        <p id="last-p">
          besides discord you can contact me thru email, though, response may
          vary
